## Overview: 

### Description of the communication protocols:
	1. We met 3 times over the course of the week.

### Outline of the project (this may include images, but they should be easy to follow and digest)
	1. The goal is to use 7 seasons of historical data (2010-2017) for the top 5 leagues to determine which performance categories are
the best predictors of success.  We tested that data against the last 3 complete seasons for the leagues (2018-2020).  We will use our findings
predict this years champions based on the YTD data available for this season so far.
